                    <h5>Programmer & <span style="color: #0077ff;">Graphic Designer</span></h5>
                    <p>My name is <strong>Ezeme Chukwudubem</strong>, a passionate Frontend Developer and Graphics Designer based in Nigeria. 
                        I love transforming creative ideas into interactive, user-friendly web experiences. My curiosity for technology began 
                        at an early age, and over time I’ve grown into a detail-oriented developer who enjoys crafting clean, accessible interfaces.
                        Outside coding, I enjoy music, design, and learning how visual storytelling influences user interaction.

                <p>As a Frontend Developer and Graphics Designer, my primary 
                    goal is to create visually appealing and user-friendly web 
                    applications that provide seamless user experiences. I aim to continuously 
                    enhance my skills in modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and 
                    popular frameworks like React and Vue.js. Additionally, I strive to 
                    stay updated with the latest design trends and best practices to ensure 
                    that my designs are not only aesthetically pleasing but also 
                    functional and accessible. Ultimately, I aspire to contribute to 
                    innovative projects that make a positive impact on users while advancing 
                    my career in the tech industry.

                    curious, and stay connected to people; kindness and collaboration 
                    open more doors than talent alone. Keep learning, keep building 
                    your skills, and never forget where you started or the family 
                    who’s always been your foundation.

                <p>Sometimes, the biggest lessons don’t come from success 
                    but from the times things didn’t go as planned. 
                    Every bug fixed, every failed design, and every late-night 
                    debugging session is a reminder that progress isn’t always neat, 
                    it’s built on persistence. The more I learn, the more I realize 
                    how much there’s still to explore, and that’s what keeps me going.
